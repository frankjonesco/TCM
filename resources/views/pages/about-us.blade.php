            Our story
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            The orignis of True Crime Metrix were planted in a small coffe house in Coppenhagen in late summer 2018, where four unsuspecting co-workers would gather for all-to-often extended lunchbreak sessions to discuss the unfolding of the Chris Watts family murders.

            It became a daily appointment, perhaps only to be an outlet for a flavour of conversation that made most others slowly walk away.

            You'd be amazed at some of the looks you get at the watercooler when your icebreaker is "Hey, have you heard about this guy in Colorado? He murdered his whole family and hid his children in oil tanks."

        <p>
            Spured on by shared obsession, these four heads began evening meetings, weekend meetings, online summits, discussion fourms and all the other things to the point where our lives as we had previously knew them fell away and we were fully emersed into a seemingly destined, collective realisation, we were to become full-time professional sleuths.

            Who we serve
        </h3>

        <p>
            We cover the crimes we like. As independent publishers, we maintain full autonomy, thus are able to focus only on our own passions. We do not follow trends for trend's sake. We are not bound or withholden to profit-driven direction. It is our mantra that if you book them, they will come. We believe the people we serve are the people most like us. And we could not be happier to bring you the news we choose.

        <h3>Operation</h3>

        <p>
            We all have backgrounds in digital media and an eye for 'relational data collections'. That might not mean much to non-techs but it is our philisophy of operation to collate as much data as possible from the True Crime cases, to see how connections are formed organically. It's very much like Facebook's Open Graph technology.
